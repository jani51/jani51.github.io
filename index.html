        <h5>Experiment will be interesting project to work on and and I believe I will get many things out this study as well learn to use new tools. <br> Perhaps I will continue my hobby of self-hosting as well but I am unsure if it is going to turn into a nightmare since I would need to get a domain name as well as https encryption certification.</h5>
